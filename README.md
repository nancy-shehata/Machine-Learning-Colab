# Social Network Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis and testing of social network data using machine learning techniques. The primary goal of this notebook is to explore and evaluate patterns within social network datasets, 
which may include user behavior, connections, interactions, and other relevant factors.

## Project Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes steps to clean and prepare the social network data for analysis, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical methods are used to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the social network data.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: The project likely includes training and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., classification or clustering) to analyze or predict user behaviors within the social network.
  
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques such as cross-validation, confusion matrix, accuracy score, and other relevant metrics are used to assess model performance.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter

## Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-network-analysis.git

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Navigate to the folder where the repository is cloned and open the Jupyter notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook Social_Network_Test_2.ipynb

3. **Run the Cells**: 
   Execute the cells in the notebook to run the analysis, train models, and view the results.

## Future Improvements

- Include additional machine learning models for comparison.
- Use a larger and more diverse dataset for better insights.
- Expand the analysis to include temporal patterns in the social network data.
