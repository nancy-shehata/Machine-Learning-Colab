# K-Means Clustering on Breast Cancer Data

## Overview

This project applies **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to breast cancer data. The goal is to explore and analyze the data using clustering techniques, aiming to group similar data points and potentially discover hidden patterns in the dataset. While the project uses K-Means for clustering, the results could provide insights into the characteristics of malignant and benign tumors.

## Project Details

- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering
- **Dataset**: Breast cancer data, which likely includes various features
- **Objective**: To cluster the data into groups based on similarities in features and identify the clusters that could represent different tumor types (e.g., malignant vs benign).
  
## Key Features

- **Preprocessing**: The notebook includes data preprocessing steps, such as:
  - Handling missing values (if any).
  - Normalizing or standardizing the features to ensure effective clustering.
  
- **K-Means Algorithm**:
  - Implementation of the K-Means algorithm to group data points based on feature similarity.
  - Selection of an appropriate number of clusters using methods like the **Elbow method** or **Silhouette score**.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Cluster quality is evaluated using metrics like inertia or within-cluster sum of squares.
  - Visualization techniques like scatter plots are used to help understand how well the data was clustered.

## Setup:To run this project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries (listed in the notebook or `requirements.txt`):
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open and run the `kmeans_breastcancer.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment:
   bash
   jupyter notebook kmeans_breastcancer.ipynb

## Results and Insights

- The clusters generated by K-Means will be visualized and interpreted to understand the grouping of the data points.
- Additional insights on how the clusters relate to the original labels (if available) may be drawn to evaluate the model's performance.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.
- Improve the model by tuning hyperparameters
